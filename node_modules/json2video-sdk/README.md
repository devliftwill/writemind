## Hello world
JSON2Video makes video creation easy as a piece of cake:

```javascript
    const {Movie, Scene} = require("json2video-sdk");
        
    async function main() {
        // Create a new movie
        let movie = new Movie;

        // Set your API key
        // Get your free API key at https://json2video.com
        movie.setAPIKey(YOUR_API_KEY);

        // Set movie quality: low, medium, high
        movie.set("quality", "high");

        // Generate a video draft 
        movie.set("draft", true);

        // Create a new scene
        let scene = new Scene;

        // Set the scene background color
        scene.set("background-color",  "#4392F1");

        // Add a text element printing "Hello world" in a fancy way (style 003)
        // The element is 10 seconds long and starts 2 seconds from the scene start
        scene.addElement({
            type: "text",
            style: "003",
            text: "Hello world",
            duration: 10,
            start: 2
        });

        // Add the scene to the movie
        movie.addScene(scene);

        // Call the API and render the movie
        let render = await movie.render();
        console.log(render);

        // Wait for the movie to finish rendering
        await movie
            .waitToFinish((status) => {
                console.log("Rendering: ", status.movie.status, " / ", status.movie.message);
            })
            .then((status) => {
                console.log("Movie is ready: ", status.movie.url);
                console.log("Remaining final movies: ", status.remaining_quota.movies);
                console.log("Remaining drafts: ", status.remaining_quota.drafts);
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                console.log("Error: ", err);
            });
    }

    main();
